This program will create a playable game of Tic-Tac-Toe that will allow for 1,
2, or no players. Initially the game will allow the player to create a board of
size "n" that will require a victory only if "n" marks are in a row.

Artificial Intelligence will be fully implemented using the Minimax Algorithm
with Alpha-Beta pruning.

The terminal application will be made in C++.

The game will be expanded to be 3D.

A GUI may be added later.
